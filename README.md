waste
=====

This will become the first useable todo-manager.

...as soon as I find the time...

It is under heavy development. The database-schema is not stable yet.

waste is written in Python and uses web.py, currently developped and tested on Debian Squeeze and Wheezy.

Features
--------

* an ugly, but colorful WebUI
* poor database-design.
* a very basic CLI client
* free defineable tags. As many tags as the DBMS (sqlite3 atm.) can handle
* free defineable status. Also as many as the DMBS can handle.
* a tagfilter
* everything is UTF-8
* ALPHA! stateless synchronisation between instances, so you can use it on any machine, offline or online.

Planned Features
----------------

* a full featured (and colorful!) CLI
* dependencies between tasks
* Documentation :-)

Features I dream about
----------------------
Maybe sombody else should do it...

* A client for Android
* Integration in the "Awesome" windowmanager

Features I can not add
----------------------
    
* a client for iOS. I don't own a Mac, nor an iPhone/iPad/iPod. But I would be very happy if someone else would do it and I would help as much as I can.
* a client Windows Phone. Same as above.
* a client for Symbian. (HAHAHA)

Roadmap
=======

Version 1.0
-----------

Implement all the planned features and all the other ones, I need. The code will be a mess, but I can handle my stuff with it.

Version 2.0
-----------

Complete rewrite with (maybe) the same features.
