This will become a useable todo-manager.

...as soon as I find the time...

Features
--------

    * a colorful WebUI
    * free defineable Tags. As many tags as the DBMS (sqlite3 atm.) can handle
    * free defineable Status. Also as many as the DMBS can handle.

Planned Features
----------------

    * a (colorful) CLI
    * stateless synchronisation between instances, so you can use it on any machine, offline or online
    * dependencies between tasks

Features I dream about
----------------------
Stuff, maybe sombody else should do it...

    * A client for Android
    * Integration in the "Awesome" Windowmanager

Features I can not add
----------------------
    
    * a client for iOS. I don't own a Mac, nor an iPhone/iPad/iPod. But I would be very happy if someone else would do it and I would help as much as I can.
    * a client Windows Phone. Same as above.
    * a client for Symbian. (HAHAHA)
